            <p>
                So... I got bored and decided to add this Blog section to my site. 
                Honestly I have no idea what I will be writing about here but its cool to have a platform like this where I can share whats on my mind
            </p>



            <h3>Current Focus</h3>
            <p>
                Right now my focus is on finishing my 1st year of college so I can have a laidback summer.
                Really trying to further my music career as well, sort of thought it would be hard to balance that with college but 
                its easier than I thought tbh.
            </p>

            <h3>What to Expect</h3>
            <p>
                In this blog, I plan to write about:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>My experiences at Algebra University & career in general.</li>
                <li>Deep dives into stuff I find interesting in CS and in music.</li>
                <li>Reviews of tools and technologies I'm learning.</li>
                <li>Challenges I face and how I overcome them.</li>
                <li>Personal coding projects and their development process.</li>
            </ul>


            <p>
                I guess stay tuned for more?
